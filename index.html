            <a href="#cite-1" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            Victor was likely born in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudeten_Germans" class="text-blue-600 font-bold underline underline-offset-4">
                Czechoslovakia
            </a>, 
            but he was raised in Germany and spoke German as his first language. This is corroborated by his immigration 
            papers, which state that he was born in what is now the Czech Republic, as well as a passport that the Author has seen. 
            The Author has not seen his birth certificate.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-3">
            Victor's grandfather, Paul, was a career military man and served for Germany in both World Wars, 
            including the <em>Afrika Korps</em> under
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" class="text-blue-600 font-bold underline underline-offset-4">
                Erwin Rommel
            </a>. He died of pneumonia when Victor was a child.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-3">
            Victor remembered summers at his grandparents' farm; a chicken that would follow him around, his mother struggling
            to dispatch a headless duck, and exploring the nearby woods.
        </p>

        <p id="2" name="2" class="pt-3">

            <a href="#cite-2" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            Alois was an officer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> and served
            in France for much of the war. He was captured by the Americans and held as a prisoner of war in 1945. A classically trained
            musician and opera baritone, he resumed his career after the war and performed in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Oper_Berlin">Deutsche Oper Berlin</a> and the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oper_Frankfurt">Oper Frankfurt</a>.

            <a href="#cite-3" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            To the Author's knowledge, Yarmil was older than Alois by a few months. 
        </p>

            <a href="#cite-4" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>

            He was introduced to motorcycles by his uncle on his mother's side, who had several daughters but no sons.
            Victor was critically injured in a crash at Brno Circuit in 1961 that left him with reduced mobility in his left leg. His mother did
            not speak to her brother for several years after the accident.
        </p>

            <a href="#cite-6" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            Victor visited the Soviet Union five times, as well as other Eastern Bloc countries. One of his favorite stories was about
            a German woman who insisted that she take several kilos of Hungarian peaches on board the train and was subsequently
            eating peaches for the rest of the trip.
        </p>

            <a href="#cite-7" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            Victor never shared the name of his first wife; the Author only knows that she was from
            Bari, Italy, and her parents owned a company that made baby clothes. The Author has never met his half-sister.

            His resume states that he earned a bachelors degree in Economics from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in 1966.
            It erroneously listed Mainz as being in Hesse, rather than Rhineland-Pfalz.
        </p>

            <a href="#cite-9" class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">^</a>
            According to Victor, Pan Am flew to 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Son_Nhut_Air_Base" class="text-blue-600 font-bold underline underline-offset-4">
                Tan Son Nhut Air Base
            </a> 
            to transport cargo and personnel. He was shocked to witness
            shelling on the base and realized that he was in a war zone. 
            He was sponsored by 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater_Jr." class="text-blue-600 font-bold underline underline-offset-4">
                US Representative Barry Goldwater, Jr. 
            </a>
            (R-CA 27th District) and because of his employment, eschewed
            military transport for a first class seat on a Pan Am 747.
            Victor said he only had to pay airport taxes at London
            Heathrow (about $10 in 1971), then flew to New York City JFK.

            He arrived in New York on February 3 in below freezing temperatures. When he arrived in Los Angeles, it was about 60 degrees F.
            Victor recounted an impromptu tour of Manhattan by an unscrupulous cabbie, an attempted mugging on a subway with other
            Europeans (it was thwarted by a plainclothes officer who took a seat next to them), and the largest rat he had ever seen
            on a restaurant table.

            With Pan Am reducing its operations in the 1970s, Victor did not know quite what to do. A fellow German ex-pat, Mr. Kirsch,
            helped him find a job at Bank of America's international division in downtown Los Angeles.

            Day-to-day operations were handled by Nick's brother, Boris. Victor employed several guards to cover shifts 24/7
            as well as off duty LAPD officers. He was responsible for security at the studio and the parking lot across the street.
